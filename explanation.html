      <h1>Explanation of local government</h1>
      <p>In non-metropolitan areas, communities are either governed by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A lower tier <b>district council</b> (occasionally called a "district" or a "shire district").</li>
        <li>An upper tier <b>county council</b> (occasionally called a "shire county").</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>or,</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A single-tier <b>unitary authority</b>, which holds the powers of both a county council and a district council. Unitary authorities are legally considered lower-tier councils that can also perform the actions of a county council.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In Scotland and Wales, all local government is single-tier. Scotland is governed by 32 councils, commonly called "<b>Scottish councils</b>", and Wales is governed by 22 "principal councils", commonly known as <b>Welsh unitaries</b>.</p>
      <p>In metropolitan areas, communities are governed by a <b>metropolitan borough</b>. For historical reasons this is legally considered a lower-tier authority, but <em>de facto</em> wields the power of a unitary authority. <b>London boroughs</b> are very similar to metropolitan boroughs, but legally different.</p>
      <p>The UK government refers to the low<em>est</em> tier of local government (i.e. district councils, metropolitan boroughs, London boroughs, unitary authorities, Scottish councils and Welsh authorities) as <b>local authority districts</b>. These are not to be confused with district councils. LADs are made up of <b>wards</b>, which elect one or more councillors. County councils are made up of <b>electoral divisions</b>, although some unitary authorities choose to refer to their wards as electoral divisions.</p>
      <p>LADs can choose to pool their resourced to become a <b>combined authority</b>; similarly, upper-tier authorities can pool their resources to form a <b>combined county authority</b>. CA/CCAs are not directly elected, but made up of representatives from their constituent councils. They can, however, choose to have directly-elected <b>mayors</b>. Note that the Greater London Authority and its mayorality are not part of a combined authority, but are legally distinct.</p>
      <p>Devolved assemblies (the Senedd, Scottish Parliament, and London Assembly) are not related to this system of local government.</p>
      <p>For a deeper explanation of how and why the system is the way it is, see the <a href="history.html">history page</a>.</p>
      <h2>What does Octolamp show?</h2>
      <p>Octolamp currently provides three views:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Local authority districts</b>: it is possible to view the political makeup of all LADs in a given year, or of those elected in a given year.</li>
        <li><b>Wards</b>: for the years 2021â€”2024 inclusive, elections to local authorities can be further broken down and viewed by ward.</li>
        <li><b>County councils</b>: electoral results for county councils can be viewed in any given year.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Octolamp does not currently support viewing the results of mayoral elections for combined authorities and combined county authorities.</p>
