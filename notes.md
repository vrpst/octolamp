# Notes (stuff I need to remember that isn't worth putting on the website)
- County council elections only happened in 2025, 2021, 2017, etc.
- Wales and Scotland are every five years, not four
- There was no map for the 2025 boundaries for county councils, but since no changes have happened I've just used the 2024 map
- 2024 has no LAD data â€” I can use the ward data to build the LAD stuff *and also the county stuff* because there were no county council elections then
- Everything before 2017 in Scotland and Wales is designated as not having data; since there were no changes in England pre-2019, everything pre-2019 inclusive that isn't explicitly carved out (as I have done) as being new is rendered as insufficient data.
